## üéØ Unified File Interface Benefits

### Clean, Semantic API
```typescript
const files: FileInput[] = [
  { type: 'image', data: "dashboard.png", detail: "high" },
  { type: 'document', data: "sales.xlsx", options: { maxRows: 100 } },
  { type: 'document', data: "employees.csv" }
];

await agent.invoke({
  objective: "Analyze business performance across all departments",
  files: files
});
```

### Professional Capabilities
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript discriminated unions prevent runtime errors
- **Automatic Processing**: No manual tool configuration required
- **Performance Optimized**: Built-in limits for production use
- **Industry-Specific**: Ready-made workflows for common business scenarios

## üìÅ Sample Data Files

All examples use realistic sample data included in the `sample-data/` directory:

- `financial-data.csv` - Monthly revenue, expenses, and profit data
- `repair-estimates.csv` - Auto insurance repair cost estimates  
- `patient-vitals.csv` - Medical patient vital signs history
- `market-data.csv` - Real estate market comparables
- `inspection-data.csv` - Manufacturing quality control measurements
- `employees.csv` - Employee performance and department data
- `company-data.xlsx` - Multi-sheet business data

- **Process Optimization**: Visual equipment status with performance metrics
- **Compliance Reporting**: Product photos with certification documentation

### Business Intelligence
- **Executive Reporting**: Dashboard charts with underlying KPI data
- **Performance Analysis**: Employee photos with productivity metrics
- **Market Analysis**: Competitor visual content with market share data

## üí° Best Practices

### File Organization
- **Group related files** in the same workflow for better context
- **Use descriptive objectives** that reference both visual and data elements
- **Specify processing options** for large datasets (maxRows, sheetName)

### Performance Optimization
- **Set maxRows limits** for large Excel/CSV files (default: 1000)
- **Use appropriate image detail levels** ('high' for charts, 'auto' for photos)
- **Monitor file sizes** (10MB limit for documents)

### Error Handling
- **Files are processed individually** - invalid files are skipped with warnings
- **Check file existence** before processing
- **Use try-catch blocks** for production workflows
